Real Media is a proprietary multimedia container format 
created by RealNetworks. File with extension of ".rm" 
contains typically CBR (constant bitrate) streams, while 
".rmvb" contains VBR (variable bitrate) streams. 

Code here is a parser implementation of Real Media file. 
It is based on a open-source code of librmff. The parser 
packs media content frames into RDT packets.
